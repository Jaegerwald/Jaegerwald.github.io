What's with these homies, dissin my girl?
Why do they gotta front?

What did we ever do to these guys
that made them so violent

Woo-hoo
But you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo
And I know you're mine
Woo-hoo
And that's for all of time

Oo-wee-hoo I look just like buddy holly
Oh-oh and you're mary tyler moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care bout that

Dont't you ever fear 
I'm always near
I know that you need help
Your tounge is twisted
Your eyes are slit
You need a guardian

Woo-hoo
But you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo
And I know you're mine
Woo-hoo
And thats for all of time

Oo-wee-hoo I look just like buddy holly
Oh-oh and you're mary tyler moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care bout that

Bang Bang a knock on the door
Another big bang and you're down on the floor
Oh no - what do we do?
Don't look now but I lost my shoe
I can't run and I can't kick
What's the matter babe are you feeling sick
What's the matter-
What's the matter-
What's the matter You?
What's the matter are you feeling blue?

Oh-oh-oo-oh-ohuo

And that's for all of time
And that's for all of time

(Electric Guitar Riff)

Oo-wee-hoo I look just like buddy holly
Oh-oh and you're mary tyler moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care bout that
I don't care bout that
I don't care bout that
I don't care bout that
I don't care bout that
