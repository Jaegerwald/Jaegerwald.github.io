    <div>Elo! I'm Jaegerwald, I'm a (probably small) Software Dev, 2/3D Artist, and (soon) a Game Developer!
    I am from and live in Austria (A pretty neat country! Although I might be a bit biased.)
    <br><br>I've taught myself how to code, but my projects are usually very scuffed; and I tend to use depricated stuff [Without knowing that the thing im using IS depricated.
    (I haven't stopped using the center tag until 2023 :/)]</div>
