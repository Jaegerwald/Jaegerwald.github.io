                I have started to teach programming to myself in 2018 with a few YouTube tutorials.
                Over the time, I've gotten better and better, until where I am now!

                Ever since kindergarten, I've always been a little creative.
                Most of my drawing style is completly figured out by mself,
                but of course I also learn something new every day!
